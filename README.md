# Leader_Election_Algorithms
It is an assignment for Y2 COMP212 in UOL. Since the limited time and approached deadline, this simulator isn't built perfectly, especially in the HS part. This message object was introduced when i just finished the  LCR part and started HS, hence it seems a little werid that the LCR algorithm contains no message object. Anyway, it still a good simulator.
